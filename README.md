# Fusion
The Fusion Stellaar Model is designed to predict and classify
stellar attributes with higher accuracy than traditional formulas. 
It takes inputs of a star's Effective Temperature, Luminosity, and 
Radius, and runs its Deep Neural Network algorithm to predict and 
classify other attributes of a star such as Mass, Surface Gravity, 
etc. It is trained on the ESA's Gaia mission dataset with over 403 
million features.  

### The Project
The Fusion model is a Deep Neural Network that
